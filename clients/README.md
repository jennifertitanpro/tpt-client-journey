# Clients Directory

This directory stores client journey data. Each client has their own subdirectory named with their email address (@ replaced with _at_).

## Structure

```
clients/
├── client_at_example.com/
│   └── journey.json
├── another_at_example.com/
│   └── journey.json
└── README.md (this file)
```

## Note

Client data files are automatically created and managed by the TPT Client Journey application. Do not manually edit these files unless you understand the data structure.
